## Introduction
Hi! Everyone!
This open source is aimed at face recognition in real time using smart phone. The platform integrates smartphones, servers and the Web.

After the face recognition is performed by the server, the user receives information on the corresponding person through the smart phone.

The server was used to prevent the overload of the smartphone. Administrators can do various tasks such as DB and user data management through the web. The platform can also automatically recognize celebrities using the Clova Face Recognition API and the Naver News API.

* The smartphone displays the face of the people in the camera through a rectangle to the user and provides the information of the person processed by the server.
